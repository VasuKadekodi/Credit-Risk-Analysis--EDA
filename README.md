💼📈 This is a project of a consumer finance company, which is specialize in lending various types of loans to urban customers. the business objective is to identify patterns that indicate if a client has difficulty paying their installments, which will help to make informed decisions such as denying the loan, reducing the loan amount, or lending to risky applicants at a higher interest rate.

🔍📊 To achieve our objective, we will conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to analyze the patterns present in the data. By identifying strong indicators of default, we can understand the driving factors behind loan default and utilize this knowledge for portfolio and risk assessment.

💻🤔 To develop a better understanding of the domain, we will research risk analytics and understand the types of variables and their significance. Our ultimate goal is to ensure that the applicants capable of repaying the loan are not rejected and make data-driven decisions to reduce financial risks.
